# Lab Report4
## Test snippet
It is unknown if the test works in different codes.\
In this lab, we have three different snippets and two different codes to test each of them and see how it work. Also, we can see if we can find a way to debug and make it work.

## Snippet 1
```
[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)`

```
## Snippet 2
```
[a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
```

## Snippet 3
```
